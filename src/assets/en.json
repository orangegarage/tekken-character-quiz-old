    },
    "flavortexts":
    {
        "Alisa Bosconovitch": "Alisa's biggest characteristic is her superior movement.\nAlisa excels in the 'neutral', where she can utilize her backdashes and sidesteps to slowly chip away at the opponent.\nDodging moves and linking them to combos in seemingly impossible situations, Alisa is a high tier character that you can see often in tournaments.\nFrom a new player's perspective, her chainsaws and d+3 can provide her with a gimmicky victory, but in a perfect world, Alisa doesn't rely on her stances.\nnAlisa's neutral moves and optimal combos are very easy to execute, making her a good character to start with.\nHowever, Alisa does have slightly lower punish damage as well as limited combo routes to compensate.\nIf you want to enjoy Tekken's 3D fighting mechanics to the fullest, Alisa would be a great choice for you.\nRecommended Players: Chanel, AO, Cuddle Core",
        "Akuma / Gouki": "Coming straight from the SF universe, Gouki/Akuma is the hired hitman to bring an end to the Mishima Bloodline.\nWhile he was considered to have OP potential since S1, he avoided a hefty balance patch due to his extreme difficulty.\nIn season 2, the influx of skilled Akuma players from Pakistan proved that the explosive combo damage and the bending of the traditiona Tekken system needed a nerf.\nDespite this, even after heavy nerfs Akuma continues to have an almost unfair combo damage only held back by his execution barrier.\nWhile he boasts one of the highest gameplay difficulty in Tekken, if one has acquired all his tech, it is possible to rip off wins against characters you don't even know.\nIf you come from a 2D game and are used to the commands, perhaps Akuma can be the character for you, but keep in mind that his EX gauge and projectiles will make him different from traditional Tekken characters.\nRecommended Players: Awais Honey, Atif Butt, DaddyKing, K2RO, Eunja",
        "Anna Williams": "Sister to Nina Williams, Anna is the 'ooh look I have sex appeal with a fiery temper' character of Tekken.\nPerhaps fitting for her personality, Anna in game is a high risk, high return character who puts all her chips on the next big 50/50 mixup.\nWhile on good days this can bring Anna wins after wins with never-ending momentum, this comes with a significant de-merit that her best mixups come when she is crouching, and her lows are very punishable.\nThe higher in rank you go, this is emphasized by her short reach and weak tracking to SSL - the reason Anna is a low tier character.\nHowever, her execution isn't too difficult, so if you are a newcomer to Tekken looking for a risky, 50/50 character that also happens to drip sex appeal, go right on ahead!\nRecommended Players: Fran, 200won",
        "Armor King": "If King represents the glory in the ring, Armor King is the wrestler of the night, the shady alleys, and vigilante justice.\nIf you are a King player, Armor King's gameplan would make sense to you - wavedash in, poke with your lows, if the opponent whiffs, you launch.\nOf course, you shouldn't forget to mix in a healthy dose of chain grabs.\nUnfortunately, Armor King is slightly more execution heavy then King, as his main tool to whiff punish requires a fnddf command.",
        "Asuka Kazama": "While people may say Asuka is spammy, she has good reason to be - a low that is + on hit, a great df2, a decent parry, and a fast counterhit combo move that shines in tight situations - along with her strings and cartwheel.\nHer moves are all beginner friendly and can get gimmicky, making her a great starter character for more players wanting a more casual experience.\nWhile her execution is easy and has good tools and damage, she lacks a 10f punish string and is weak to sidesteps, placing her in a middling tier.\nIf you are looking for a easy character to try out Tekken with that has the potential to go higher, Asuka will not disappoint.\nRecommended Players: Dimeback, Hakuren", 
        "Bob (Robert Richards)": "Personification of speed and weight itself, Bob Richards has great mids, damage, and a hellsweep.\nIf that wasn't enough for you, he has a great powercrush mid that lets him skip his turn on defense and hop back on the offense.\nHis cons are that he lacks a 15f combo punisher, and like all hellsweeps, has a big risk of getting blocked.\nStill, if you are looking for an aggressive mixup character where you set the pace of attack, Bob will be the choice for you.\nRecommended Players: Ulsan",
        "Bryan Fury": "While Bryan is pure chaotic evil, in online play he is a very \"honest\" character that doesn't have many gimmicks or wonky moves.\nAs a result, he may be a difficult character for a beginner to rank up with, and is not seen often in TWT.\nHowever, he doesn't have a demanding execution barrier and boasts a simple, counterhit focused gameplan.\nThat combined with his cool moves and hit effects make Bryan a very popular secondary character.\nBryan plays using his safe, poking mixups, and takes advantage of the opponent's risky plays with his counterhit moves.\nOne must keep in mind that the true strength of Bryan comes from a stable defense.\nRecommended Players: Knee, JimmyJTran, Bilal, YSEMulti",
        "Claudio Serafino": "As the leader of the Archers of Sirius, Claudio has a unique gameplan made possible thanks to his alpha and omega - Noble Step (Burn Knuckle)\nIt is hard to dodge, with a fast startup, high guardback, and plus frames on block. It's only downside is that it is a high.\nNoble Step enables Claudio to have a unique mid/high mixup, as opposed to most characters' mid/low mixups.\nThe current Claudio meta is to pressure the opponent to the wall with Noble Step, then rack up damage with ss4 and df3,2, both low risk moves.\nClaudio's long hopkick reach also gives him the edge in whiff-punishing, but he does struggle in close combat and catching up from a health deficit due to his lack of fast, damaging lows and evasive moves.\nDespite his flaws, he is still a character considered high tier that may be worth considering if you want to start learning.\nRecommended players: Mulgold, Breadman, Shadow20z",
        "Devil Jin": "Unlike his Kazama counterpart, Devil Jin plays more like the traditional Mishima bloodline - including the difficulty.\nMishimas are commonly considered the hardest characters to play in Tekken - although Akuma still reigns supreme.\nAs such, Devil Jin is not recommended for beginning players, since you need to learn sophisticated commands in addition to learning Tekken.\nDifficulty aside, Devil Jin has amazing moves including, of course, the newly buffed EWGF.\nHis strong mids and lows complementing it gives Devil Jin a higher comeback rate.\nAs such, Devil Jin places higher than average in most metas, and a common top tier pick in tournaments.\nRecommended Players: Knee, Qudans, Saint, Choksae, Soyongdori",
        "Eddy Gordo": "If you are a new fighting game player, you can have fun with Eddy's moveset, robbing people of wins through his evasive stances and easy mixup opportunities.\nEddy's backdash is one of the best in the game, but he compensates by having a abyssmal sidestep - his biggest flaw and a reason his tier drops as the ranks go higher.\nWhile he is truly a unique character that will have you stand out from the crowd, it also means that if you start playing with Eddy, you have to re-learn some parts of Tekken for other characters.\nOf course, if you are looking to get started and just enjoy the game, this shouldn't be a problem for you.\nBut, if you are looking to play Tekken seriously, it is hard to recommend Eddy as his limits are very clear in the highest competitions.\nRecommended Players: JeonDding, Abel del Maestro",
        "Fahkumram": "Fahkumram has been a hot potato of the Tekken community since his debut, with his great safe mid options and wonky hitboxes boosting him to the top of the tier charts.\nRegardless of what people may say, it is undeniable that Fahkumram looks great, and is easy to get into.\nHis design allows for easy spacing and mixups - but unlike traditional mixups, Fahkumram's revolves around string cancelling and hold commands.\nAs a new player to Tekken, there may be some confusion getting adjusted to his combos.\nDon't look down on it however, his pokes easily add up and counterhits lead to high damage.\nHowever, as a Muay Thai fighter, his moves are very intuitive and his long limbs give him great spacing - if you are looking to learn Tekken more seriously, Fahkumram is definitely a great character to start with.\nRecommended Players: Knee, JDCR, Ulsan, LowHigh, DaddyKing",
        "Feng Wei": "The merciless martial artist Feng Wei has a variety of pokes and supporting stances - combined with his auto parry, Feng lets you focus on crafting your perfect aggression.\nMany of Feng's moves have built in defense, so it covers the potential blind spots you may have during your offense that would have been exploitable for any other character.\nTherefore, he excels in the conservative neutral game but lacks in combo damage. A silver lining would be that his launchers aren't that good anyway, so you wouldn't be looking for combos in the first place.\nUnfortunately, this does knock him down a few pegs tier-wise with the current high-combo damage meta.\nEven so, Feng Wei's strong, tracking, basic attacks will let you inflict damage on the most defensive of foes.\nFeng Wei does have great stances, but you don't need to rely on them to play the character well.\nOverall, if you are trying out a fighting game for the first time, Feng Wei could be a good choice thanks to his moves handling both offense and defense for you.\nRecommended Players: Yuu, Nishi, Kswdang, TeJJ, Hao",
        "Gigas": "Newly introduced in Tekken 7, Gigas is the adoptive father of Katarina who was captured by G-Corporation and turned into a biotech mutation to rival Jack-7.\nGigas has one of the highest range of the cast, letting him play an 'offensive defense' through his long keepaway jabs.\nGigas' versatile jab can counterhit characters trying to close the distance, and is combined with a useful array of WR(while running) moves that can quickly close the gap.\nHis long range means he also has a great whiff punishing ability.\nHowever, Gigas is considered a low tier character in high ranks due to his bad movement, big hitbox, and unsafe frames on key moves.\nBecause of that, I'm sure some people might disagree when I say that Gigas is a 'beginner friendly' character, but he does have an undeniably great range, simple gameplan and execution that complements his pros, and the added benefit of not needing complicated movement.\nOf course, play him at your own risk - he does have clear, exploitable faults that might frustrate you later down the road.\nRecommended Players: Dotoring, Youjin Boy, DaddyKing, Why",
        "Geese Howards": "Introduced as a KoF crossover, Geese brings his rappuken, power gauge, and the famed Howard Estate to Tekken 7.\nWhile he doesn't have a big, unseeable low like a hellsweep, he does meet the requirements for a potential, well rounded character, and there are many hacks to execute his difficult combos.\nHe has faced nerfs in S2, but still remains a viable pick in tournaments.\nGeese has explosive combo damage and strong movesets amplified by his power gauge, letting him comeback from a huge health deficit.\nWhile challenging, he can output consistent combos through practice (as opposed to Akuma), so if you are coming from a 2D fighting game, Geese could be a great way to learn Tekken.\nRecommended Players: Knee, Meo-Il, Destiny, SunChip",
        "Ganryu": "Ganryu returns in Tekken 7 as Julia's no.1 fan\nUnfortunately, Ganryu's lack of playerbase may be synonymous with the reason for his constant rejection - unflattering looks.\nLooks aside, Ganryu is an amazing character for new Tekken players thanks to his simple gameplan and easy execution.\nEven completely new players would be able to make some headaway with Ganryu by just using his d/f+3, d/f+2, and b2,1.\nHis stable aggression and low risk pokes will add up over time, especially with his decent damaging combos.\nGanryu will be a great companion for both casual starting players, and players who are looking to start learning Tekken seriously, with the only drawback being a small playerbase.\nRecommended Players: Saint",
        "Heihachi Mishima": "The Zeus of Tekken, the leader of Mishima Zaibatsu is also the origin for every major character and the cause of every shitty event in Tekken.\nHe's a Mishima, but in the entry level, he doesn't necessarily need the difficult Mishima commands.\nHis strong mid options allow him to hold his own in neutral situations even without EWGF, and even has mixups with simple commands.\nBecause of his simple execution in mixups, if you are a player trying to learn Mishimas, Heihachi would be a great start.\nDo keep in mind, however, that as you rank up, you will start requiring the traditional Mishima skills. If you haven't improved sufficiently by then, you will reach a serious dilemma.\nRecommended Players: JDCR, Knee, Choksae",
        "Hwoarang": "Hailing from South Korea, Hwoarang is a character who can suffocate the opponent through his free-flowing aggression, trapping them in an endless vortex of punches and kicks.\nOpponents who can't escape this pressure will inevitably find themselves up in the air after getting hit by a just frame skyrocket.\nFunnily enough, Hwoarang also has great grappling options, which don't make him a grappler, but supplements his mixups and potentially setting up a base for his Okizeme.\nHwoarang offers great versatility in his combos and offense, but his moves and stances leave him vulnerable to sidesteps and well-telegraphed counters.\nBecause of his high risk, high reward moveset, Hwoarang players must know when to pause and resume aggression on the fly, sometimes even in the middle of a mixup.\nDue to his multiple stances and associated execution and gameplan difficulty, Hwoarang is not recommended to newer players.\nHowever, if you enjoy flashy, high damage combos and smooth, flowing aggression, Hwoarang might prove to be worth grinding your life into.\nRecommended players: Yeonarang, TKMuse, Rest, Knee, MacRoya",
        "Jack - 7": "Jack is a very versatile character that can go far with simple execution and gameplay. His long reach and low risk moves let him build up a lead safely.\nJack also has a very good throw game with a command grab for every occasion.\nHis hitbox also gives you the advantage as you backdash away, and combined with your long range, whiff punishing will never be easier.\nDo note that Jack’s neutral jab is 11F (1 frame slower than most), lacks a hopkick, and has a harder time sidestepping.\nJack is a very versatile character that has tools for almost every situation.\nWhile weaker compared to the season 1 days where he was a staple in every tournament, Jack-7 is still a solid, mid tier character that you can see in TWT.\nWith his lower execution barrier and versatile toolkit, he is a great character to start with.\n If you are looking for a character that excels in any situation, one that can adapt to you as your playstyle changes, look no further than the trusty Jack-7.\nRecommended players: Anakin, Saint, Noroma, Casiel",
        "Jin Kazama": "Jin is a very solid, versatile character that feels like the embodiment of all Tekken values.\nWhile his moveset gives him versatility everywhere, his defense is accentuated thanks to his amazing parry.\nLater, once one learns EWHF, Jin can also be played extremely aggressively, becoming almost oppressive with his F+4 counterhits and EWHF whiff punishes.\nWhile not exactly a Mishima, if you are looking to steadily improve on your Mishima skills, Jin is probably the best choice.\nRecommended players: CherryBerryMango, Knee, Book",
        "Josie Rizal": "As a kickboxer, perhaps it is natural for Josie to have one of the best frame punishes in the cast, along with some dangerous pokes and switch stance mixups.\nJosie must poke down the opponent with her switch stanced mixups while being on the lookout for any counterhit potential.\nHer great punishes and small mixup options make her a decent character for beginners, but Josie's execution may get more demanding to unlock her full potential.\nIf you are looking for a character who has a smooth defense to offense transition accompanied by strong options in close combat, Josie Rizal could be your girl.\nRecommended Players: Secret",
        "Julia Chang": "Julia Chang boasts one of the best forward movement in the game thanks to party crasher and swift step.\nUnfortunately, she has a very mediocre sidestep, one of the worst among the female characters.\nShe can use those aggressive lunges to herd the opponent to the wall, where they will be forced to deal with Julia's seemingly never-ending low/mid mixups.\nJulia benefits from an agressive okizeme playstyle, where she has strong 50/50 options both while standing and sitting.\nJulia is also a superior grappler with Mad Axe, one of the fastest throws in the game, and has high damaging combos with great wall carry.\nAll these together have Julia as a top tier character that is seen frequently in high level tournaments.\nUnfortunately, Julia has an intermediate execution hurdle in order to use her highest damage combos that may seem daunting to a newcomer.\nJulia is a character that can improve with you, as your execution grows stronger and her combo damage jumps, you can progress with this character to new heights.\nRecommended players: HelpMe, Chanel, Rangchu, JeonDding, MaD",
        "Kazuya Mishima": "Kazuya benefits strongly from aggressively pursuing an okizeme through his hellsweep and lion slayer.\nSome players thrive on this scenario and set up aggressive vortexes that is almost impossible to get out of.\nHowever, since his hellsweep can get heavily punished upon block, his aggression comes at a high risk.\nBecause of the risks involved, some players enjoy taking Kazuya more defensively, using movement to whiff punish/counterhit the opponent's attack with a meaty EWGF.\nWhile Kazuya's versatility and cool moves make him a popular choice, Kazuya has one of the highest execution barriers in Tekken and therefore discouraged to new players.\nHowever, if you want a versatile Mishima strengthened with mixups, Kazuya would be the one for you.\nRecommended players: Knee, Choksae, Ryan Hart, BoaLuv, Ikari",
        "Katarina Alvez": "A newcomer in Tekken 7, Katarina uses Savate, a French kickboxing style of combat.\nTrue to her combat style, Katarina’s emphasis comes from her amazing foot strings that she can cancel out of into harrier stance.\nHer fast counterhit moves and long legs give her the edge over many characters in aggressive, close combat as well as the more defensive neutral position.\nHowever, many of her good lows are slow and risky, and her harrier stance is extremely vulnerable to sidestep right. Her nerf also shortened her hopkick range considerably.\nDue to this, not many people play Katarina on a professional level after her S2 nerfs.\nNonetheless, Katarina’s easy, powerful combos and simple but effective playstyle continues to make her a very solid choice for beginning players who want see how Tekken works.\nRecommended players: Mokujun, Rangchu, Knee, Ghirlanda",
        "Kazumi Hachijo Mishima": "As the member of the Hachijo Clan, Kazumi served as a monitor of the Mishima Zaibatsu, eventually attempting to assassinate Heihachi when his ambitions were deemed too dangerous.\nIn game, Kazumi's offense is low risk and intuitive, automatically raising her defensive capabilities as well.\nThe fact that she has amazing fast pokes mean that if the Kazumi player knows not to overextend, the opponent will not be able to find an opening for their own offense.\nWhile it is not feasible for Kazumi to play the game soley through mixups, her stance does open options for risky 50/50s. Kazumi has versatile options from offense that stems from her amazing pokes.\nWhile nerfed since season 1, Kazumi is still a top tier character that you will see in tournaments often.\nKazumi's amazing neutral makes her beginner friendly, and her moveset encompasses many of the core Tekken concepts that are important to understand.\nAs such, Kazumi is a great starting character with both casual and more serious players in mind.\nIf you are wondering which character to learn first, you can never go wrong with Kazumi.\nRecommended Players: Ulsan, Arslan Ash, Take",
        "King": "The current King is a luchador from Mexico who was under care of the first, original King's orphanage when he was young.\nNow fully grown, King II continues the original King's legacy as both a formidable wrestler and orphanage owner.\nKing has decent... everything, giving him a versatile playstyle, but he stands out the most via his aggressive mixups into grabs.\nKing's mixup is two-layered. The first layer is whether his offense will be a strike or a grab. Especially in the lower ranks, grabs act almost like a low, forcing the opponent to keep ducking, opening him up to your mids.\nOnce the grabs start landing, the mindgames go to the next step - which chain grab sequence will King execute?\nFrom a beginner's standpoint, King has a bit of a learning curve trying to learn all the chain grab commands, but it does mean he has a variety of reliable setups.\nKing shines when his setups connect into successful grabs, forcing the opponent to continue to make choices with no risk to King himself.\nWhile not the worst character for beginning players, new players may be overwhelmed trying to learn his setups, and end up getting a few unhealthy habits.\nRecommended players: Puma, Lil Majin, Hakaioh, TaiHeiYo, MBC",
        "Kuma / Panda": "Salmon master Kuma has Panda as his palette swap.\nHis odd stance with the short legs behind the rest of his body give him a hitbox advantage when backdashing and against lows.\nHis great jab and reach give him a big advantage in battles where nobody sidesteps, which in turn makes him a great defensive character.\nIf there is nothing to do, you can just stay at midrange jabbing away, and it will still be a very strong keepaway.\nThanks to his long reach, backdash, and hunting stance, Kuma/Panda is great at whiff punishing and poking.\nWhile the bears shouldn't necessarily rely on their stance, it is a great stance that improves your gameplay as you get more used to it.\nUnfortunately, due to a big hitbox and lack of tracking, the bears are currently in a lower tier than most of the cast.\nRecommended Players: Rangchu",
        "Lars Alexandersson": "Lars is a very versatile character that can be played any way you want him to.\nUnfortunately, versatility only shines when he can actually output damage. Lars' low damage makes him a swiss army knife with blades of plastic.\nAs a Lars player, you will constantly be able to do so much with him, only to lose in the end. What a tragic flaw - if only he had better attacks to counterhit...\nI did write pretty negatively about Lars, but he is still a very versatile character that you can explore Tekken with.\nStill, since he has difficult execution as well as a low tier, I don't want to recommend him to beginners.\nRecommended Players: NokDanLars, Lowhigh",
        "Leroy Smith": "Easy and powerful, Leroy is the gold standard character if you are trying Tekken for the first time.\nOriginating from New York but a practitioner of Wing Chun, Leroy is considered OP even after his nerfs.\nLeroy's versatility actually makes him stand out in everything. Great mixups from both in and out of stance, amazing parry and attacks with auto parry, superior punishes and pokes that give him the edge in neutral, the counterhit combos...\nHe is a character that you can play any way you want, and even has gimmicks to fall back on when things go south.\nOh wait, he also has easy, reliable execution and strong combos. Last but not least, he has a pet dog.\nIf you start by playing Leroy, you may have trouble transitioning to other characters purely because they will feel limited compared to Leroy.\nIf Tekken is your first fighting game and you don't mind committing to a DLC, I strongly suggest choosing Leroy.\nRecommended Players: Breadman, Chikurin",
        "Lee Chaolan": "Like staying defensive? Enjoy comboing the opponent from wall to wall? Enjoy the elegance of keepaway?\nExcellent - you should be considering Lee Chaolan. Lee is a classic defensive character who slams the attacking player back to their corner of the stage.\nThis stands out even more in the lower ranks where players have little experience playing against defensive players.\nIt also does mean you have a risk of becoming too reliant on playing keepaway and may have trouble learning other basics.\nLee excels in throwing out counterhits while poking down the opponent, and his combos have one of the best wall carries in the game.\nHis sliding mixups allow him to control the pace of the game as he wants.\nWhile not stance heavy, Lee's hitman stance does give him benefits, especially his powercrush that can preserve his attack momentum.\nWhile his looks and moves give him a big fanbase, he is still mid tier character, and his more demanding execution makes him a character for experienced players.\nRecommended Players: ImYourFather, HelpMe",
        "Lei Wulong": "Lei Wulong's identity comes from his many stances - and nobody knows what will come from it, not even the player himself.\nHis unique backdash using the backturn stance lets him run away quickly, evading combat entirely after attacking. This may lead to Lei players struggling to adjust to other characters' traditional backdashing.\nLei has a unique gameplay option based on this such as poking and running away or forcing a mixup then running away. This non traditional style of gameplay is both a pro and con for Lei.\nHis setups and risky mixups make it easy for him to get wins in lower ranks, but lose its power quickly against someone who knows Lei.\nThis is the reason Leis cause bracket upsets in tournaments, but rarely place high, keeping him in the lower-mid tier.\nDespite his tier, Lei has a dedicated following thanks to his stylish combos and enjoyable gameplay moments.\nIf you start with Lei, you will eventually have to struggle to re-learn Tekken due to it being hard to learn fundamentals. But hey, it will be fun!\nRecommended Players: Jokre, LoseAgainMan, PepperBeef2Spicy, OldChimdae, WulongMomentum, Furumizu",
        "Leo Kliesen": "Leo is a versatile, decent character all around but his one dowside is his short reach.\nIn S1, Donghoon 'Gura' Chae introduced Leo as the best beginner character for casual players, using Leo's b1,4 as a core part of gameplay.\nEven outside of b1,4, Leo can be played in a versatile way with plenty of mixups, and has easy combos with decent wall carry.\nHowever, he does have lower combo damage without a wall, and his short reach makes him weaker every season, even without receiving direct nerfs.\nRecommended Players: Gura",
        "Lili (Emile de Rochefort)": "Lili has the best sidestep in the game, bestowing upon her both offense and defense.\nDancing around the opponent, Lili operates off her pokes and plus frames. Because she can sidestep fast lows, opponents trying to slowly poke Lili down will always find themselves on the losing end.\nLili has both highs and mids that give her a frame advantage, making it hard for opponents to stand nor crouch to counter her.\nHowever, it is important to note that both Lili's offense and defense stems from her movement, making her an easy character to get into but a hard character to master.\nRecommended Players: Gura, Shine, Jiyo",
        "Lucky Chloe": "Another new character in Tekken 7, Lucky Chloe has simple yet high damage combos that punish opponent's mistakes heavily.\nLucky Chloe has great d/f1 and 1,2 punches, giving her a slight boost in short range battles.\nWhile her high evasion may call for gimmicks, you can see higher rank Lucky Chloe players force a reaction using her good basic moves then get damage through a counter hit.\nLucky Chloe has great evasion in her hopkick and cali rolls, which makes it hard to count her out even when there is a health difference.\nTherefore, she tends to rely on setups to land those high damaging launchers.\nLucky Chloe's moves are easily side-steppable and she doesn't have good fast moves other than the df1 and 1,2, making her a low tier character.\nThis doesn't necesarily apply in the lower ranks, so combined with her easy controls, Lucky Chloe is a good character for new players.\nRecommended Players: JeonDding",
        "Marshall Law": "Law has a bad rage drive, but all other tools point him to be a well rounded, top tier character.\nEven after his season 2 nerfs, Law is considered one of the best characters and commonly seen in tournaments.\nWhile Law doesn't have too hard of a execution barrier, his strong moves and combos do require a bit of practice.\nIf one can get past it, Law becomes an extremely versatile character that can be played any way you want to great effect.\nRecommended Players: LowHigh, NamelessKing(Malgu), Double",
        "Master Raven": "High damage, ninja, stances, all a recipe for gimmicky, unbalanced character.\nWell, it's true that Master Raven can play like that, but looking at her moves individually, she is actually surprisingly versatile.\nHer setup heavy, stance oriented playstyles come because her combo and wall damage is so astoundingly high.\nHowever, the combos are difficult and the player must know Master Raven's stances to a certain extent, so starting with Master Raven may lead to a lack of fundamentals down the road.\nWhile her stylish, powerful combos and mixups make Master Raven an attractive character, her difficult gameplan and execution makes her challenging to start with.\nRecommended Players: Tabibito",
        "Craig Marduk": "Your favorite wrestler Marduk is back in Season 2 DLC!\nMarduk has a unique grappling style which involves using 'mounts' as a way to land his high damage mixups, and keeping the opponent away from him through defensively utilizing his long pokes.\nMarduk's strong points are definitely his defense acquired thanks to his long reach, as well as his many mixup potential in neutral, oki, and mount.\nCombined with his easy commands, Marduk is definitely a easy and strong character that you can see in tournaments.\nHis biggest weakness is that his moves are sidesteppable, and that he surprisingly does not do well in close combat.\nIf you were looking for a burly character with high damage who likes playing keepaway until he is ready, surprise! Marduk will be perfect for you!\nRecommended Players: Knee, The JON",
        "Miguel Cabellero Rojo": "While people may say Miguel is still weak, aside from his reach and low tracking on SSL, he is a great offensive character.\nMiguel racks up damage slowly through mixing up his df1 strings and various lows.\nMiguel's Savage stance can boost his damage output even further, but he isn't a character that revolves around stances.\nHis reach does keep him at a middling tier, but other then that, Miguel is a very good character that doesn't have anything complicated.\nBecause his main drawback doesn't really show in lower ranks and easy execution, Miguel can be recommended to players first learning Tekken.\nRecommended Players: Sephiblack, Rancafe",
        "Negan": "While a crossover from the Walking Dead of all places, Negan is definitely one of the more positive cases of crossover character integration.\nPerhaps obvious with his bat, Negan has a high reach so has an easy time punishing, and also can use his pushing to bully the opponent with a no-risk counterhit potential.\nNegan has a versatile toolset, such as plus frame moves to pressure the opponent, df1 string midgames, stance mindgames, and a 1+2 throw from neutral.\nNegan's moves has great powercrush options, tanking and going through the opponent's attack for combos. This makes Negan easy to control the pace of his aggression.\nWith a good reach, easy commands and gameplan, Negan is a good character for beginners to start with.\nRecommended Players: Knee",
        "Noctis": "Little is known about this tiny boy who lost his way from SoulCaliber 15, but thanks to his many swords, Noctis has a great reach with easy, high damage combos.\nHe is a known beginner slayer in the lower ranks thanks to his plus frame moves that keep away non sidestepping players. Combined with his deadly toe poking spear, Noctis has some deadly gimmicks.\nOf course, his reliance on gimmicks mean that as soon as people start sidstepping, he runs out of options.\nDespite his being low tier, his gimmicky mixups can can take you surprisingly high, and he does have some pretty cool combos. Combined with his easy execution, Noctis is a pretty good character to pick up as a beginner.\nYou'll run into his limitations if you continue to play Tekken compeetitively, but if you want to try and see what kind of game Tekken is, why not play Noctis?\nRecommend Players: CBM",
        "Nina Williams": "When playing Nina, you may sometiems feel like you're playing alone - just an enless loop of jabs, SS+1 cancels, and the resulting pressure.\nHer amazing pressure potential through jab and SS+1 makes it so that the opponent can't even think about retaliating.\nIf they do and you land a launcher, her high damage, wall-to-wall combos will send them to the wall, which is basically hell if you're against Nina.\nShe's not a grappler, but she does have some great grab options with chain grabs and a good 1+2 throw. However, her infuriatingly short reach cancel out those pros.\nIn addition, using her main moves SS+1 and flapper consistently is very mechanically taxing, making her a hard character for beginners to play.\nRecommended Players: SteveMom, Only Practice",
        "Paul Phoenix": "Paul's insane damage and combos are basically tradition at this point. While his deathfist damage may have been nerfed, his aggression continues to shine in the top tier.\nHis great moves give him many tools and options, and in addiiton, a lot of them contain built in evasion.\nFrom a beginner's standpoint, Paul is true terror who has high damage with his amazing moves, and even has a high-risk, high reward deathfist/demoman mixup when things start going south.\nBecause he is such a strong, versatile character, Paul pays off very quickly with even a short amount of practice.\nYou will see Paul in many tournaments thanks to his high damage and potential. Maybe you will be the next biggest Paul!\nRecommended Players: Knee, Jisang, Justice, Joey Fury",
        "Sergei Dragunov": "Dragunov is a great character with versatile options centered around his aggression.\nDragunov's key move is his 'sharpner'- a low with decent damage, great frames, and tracks sidesteps. This makes it so that Dragunov does not have to try as hard as other chracters against heavy sidesteppers.\nDragunov's sharpner usage constantly gives him mixup potential against not only movement, but retaliation as well.\nThrough mixing it up with plus frame moves such as his WR+2, Dragunov can launch terrifying aggression against his opponents.\nDragunov is not a grappler character, but his moveset from combat sambo also gives him great grappling potential.\nWhile his combos can be on the harder side for beginners, his individual moves are high damage and have cool effects.\nAlthough his gimmicks won't take you very far, his power will double once you start learning the fundamentals, thanks to his versatile moveset.\nRecommended Players: JDCR, Nobi",
        "Shaheen": "A fundamentals oriented character, Shaheen has decent tools for every party.\nHe has a slide/hopkick mixup, great fast moves, and a 1+2 throw that can break floors. His high combo and wall combo damage is just a bonus.\nShaheen has no glaring weakness, but he did fall out of favor as seasons passed due to other characters simply being 'better'.\nIf you are a beginner, Shaheen may not be your first character of choice as there are higher tier characters with similar qualities, but Shaheen is an honest character who gives back what you put in.\nRecommended Players: LowHigh",
        "Steve Fox": "A genius boxer from England, Steve brings a unique gameplan to the table.\nSteve doesn't have the traditional 15 frame launcher, and as a boxer, he only uses his fists to attack. His kick inputs are used to weaving and ducking in stance, giving him an evasive edge.\nAs such, he relies on his great frame punishes and counterhits to rack up damage. This leads to Steve having quite a challenging gameplay where he ideally must know the frame data for many characters\nbut Steve's amazing quick hook and d/f+2 duck in cancel more than makes up for this in the highest level of gameplay.\nSteve players who look to maximize damage also struggle with a high execution barrier involving multiple stance cancels into complex commands.\nHowever, once you get used to his difficult commands, Steve becomes a highly versatile character that you can play any way you want to.\nWhile not recommended for beginners, if you are an accomplished player looking for a challenge, the boxer will probably give you more than enough.\nRecommended players: Knee, Heera, Gura, Lowhigh, FightSpirit",
        "Ling Xiaoyu": "Ling Xiaoyu is a high schooler dreaming of building her own amusement park one day.\nXiaoyu is a setup heavy, stance reliant character whose true potential comes from her evasion in Phoenix stance and back-turn mixups.\nHer phoenix stance puts her close to the ground, giving the perfect chance to counterhit over-eager opponents who throw out moves at the slightest frame advantage.\nThe amazing evasion in phoenix stance also gives Xiaoyu an edge over most characters in close combat.\nTo compensate, many of Xiaoyu’s neutral options are shorter in range, making it hard to actually get into range to start her dangerous mixups.\nIn the current professional meta, characters with longer range take priority, categorizing Xiaoyu as a mid tier.\nWhile Xiaoyu doesn’t have particularly hard execution, her playstyle relying heavily on stance based combat makes her unrecommended for beginners.\nHowever, if you enjoy the aggressive, in your face gamestyle, and take pride in being able to get close enough to land those mixups, you'll have fun with our Princess Ling.\nRecommended players: Sodam, P.Ling, Tanukana, Yuyu, Wecka",
        "Zafina": "Zafina is back with some weird thing on her hand.\nWhile she doesn't have a 15f launcher, all other tools are amazing. Her movement stands out the most, arguably being the best at both backdashes and sidesteps.\nIn the lower ranks, her movement rarely comes into play as stances alone net her wins against befuddled opponents, but the higher the rank you go, the less your gimmicks will work, forcing you to work with her movement based skillset.\nDon't worry too much, however, while it is extremely difficult to do correctly, her amazing movement is what makes her top tier amongst the pros.\nZafina would be another character that is easy to start out with but hard to master, as her playstyle must change dramatically based on what rank you are in.\nDespite that, her easy commands and stances (if you choose to rely on them) provide her plenty of cushion on lower ranks.\nI recommend Zafina to anyone who wants a versatile, top tier female character that they can pick up from the start and improve with.\nRecommended Players: Chanel"
